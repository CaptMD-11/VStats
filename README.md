This is the VStats Java library that computes statistics. The functionalities available include one-variable statistics, binomial & geometric distributions, matrix operations, linear regression computations, confidence intervals, significance tests, etc. 

### How does the user input data? ###

It's actually quite simple. For all the classes, I have included <samp>main</samp> methods, which allow the programs to be run. In each method (for most of the classes), I have set up some bracketed sections, where the user can input a number, array, or whatever is needed (shown below). With respect to the classes that do not have this bracket system, I am working on it :)

### How does the user receive outputs? ###

Every <samp>main</samp> method inside each class has statements that print out the output for the respective class. The user does not need to add any print statements, as everything has been pre-written. For example, here is the console output for the <samp>OneVar</samp> class:
