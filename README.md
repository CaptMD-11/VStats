# VStats

This is a repository where I push my code for various statistical calculations. This library contains computations regarding one-variable statistics, the standard normal distribution, confidence intervals, signficance tests, linear regression, binomial & geometric distributions, and more. I am currently working on the <samp>DiscreteRandom</samp> class, which computes the expected value (weighted average) of a data set, along with its respective weighted variance & standard deviation. 

### How does the user input data? ###

It's actually quite simple. For all the classes, I have included <samp>main</samp> methods, which allows each program to be run. In each method (for most of the classes), I have set up some bracketed sections, where the user can input a number, array, or whatever is needed. With respect to the classes which do not have this bracket system, I am working on it :)
