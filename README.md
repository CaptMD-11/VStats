## Installation

### How does the user input data? ###

It's actually quite simple. All the methods in VStats are <code>static</code>, so they can be called without creating objects of the VStats class. The input data to any method should be the paramter. This works similar to the Java Math library. Also, documentation is provided for all the methods in the library so that users can learn about what each invidual method actually does. The documentation was written using JavaDoc, in order for users to view the method description in a mini window, as shown in the screenshot below.
