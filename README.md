This is a repository where I push my code for various statistical calculations. This library contains computations regarding one-variable statistics, the standard normal distribution, confidence intervals, signficance tests, linear regression, binomial & geometric distributions, and more. I am currently working on the <samp>OneProportionZ</samp> class, which computes confidence intervals & significance tests for a single-proportion scenario, using the <i>z</i>-distribution. 

### How does the user input data? ###

It's actually quite simple. For all the classes, I have included <samp>main</samp> methods, which allow the programs to be run. In each method (for most of the classes), I have set up some bracketed sections, where the user can input a number, array, or whatever is needed (shown below). With respect to the classes that do not have this bracket system, I am working on it :)
